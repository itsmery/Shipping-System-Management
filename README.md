<P align="center"><img src="screenshots/web/order_tracking.png" alt="Logo" width="70%"></p>

Although the application is mainly built just for a manager of the company to manage the orders. I also built some additional functionalities for customers to use the system and a mobile version for the drivers of the company to demonstrate how the tracking order's location
functionality work.
Here's a brief look of the mobile version ðŸ“±:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

For the web application to work, you only need to focus on the backend and the shipping-system folder.

### Installation


1. Clone the repo and change to that folder
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NgoQuocBao1010/Shipping-System-Management.git
   ```

2. Install packages for the backend
    * Change folder to backend folder
      ```sh
      cd backend

      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    
    * Create certificate for Django to update Django localhost to HTTPS: Follow this [instruction](https://timonweb.com/django/https-django-development-server-ssl-certificate/). (You can take a look at my folder for reference)

    * Run the HTTPS server
      ```sh
        cd src

        python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file cert.pem --key-file key.pem
      ```

      ```js
      const OPENSERVICE_API_KEY =
      "YOUR_API_KEY";
